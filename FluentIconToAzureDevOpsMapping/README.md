#Fluent Icon to Azure DevOps Icon Mapping
This collection of files is useful to represent a mapping of icon names that are defined in the [Microsoft Fluent Icons](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/styles/web/icons) and a closest (if not exact match) for each of the icons defined in Azure DevOps (that can be used for Work Item Types)

Examples are provided in several formats: 

1. JSON File with a array defining the mapping with the closest options
2. A PowerApps / PowerFx formula creating a new Table object with the mapping - for quick use in an App.Formula as part of a PowerApp
3. A 'working' file that shows various alternatives considered for each of the icon choices

There is also a sample PowerApps Gallery that renders the list of Icons side-by-side from the mapping file
